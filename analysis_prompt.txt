ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

1. MULTI-TIMEFRAME CONFIRMATION:
   - 15m timeframe = Primary trend direction
   - 5m timeframe = Entry timing and precision
   - Both must align for high-probability trades

2. KEY INDICATORS PRIORITY:
   - EMA alignment (8/21) for trend direction
   - RSI (14) for momentum and entry timing
   - Volume ratio for breakout confirmation
   - ATR for volatility and risk sizing

3. PROVEN ENTRY PATTERNS:

   A) BREAKOUT ENTRY:
   - Price breaks key resistance/support with volume
   - Entry: Immediate or on retest
   - Stop: Below/above breakout level + ATR
   - Target: Previous swing high/low or 2:1 RR

   B) PULLBACK ENTRY:
   - Price pulls back to EMA in strong trend
   - RSI shows momentum recovery (35-50 for longs)
   - Entry: EMA bounce with volume
   - Stop: Below EMA + ATR buffer
   - Target: Next resistance level or 2:1 RR

   C) TREND CONTINUATION:
   - Clear higher timeframe trend
   - Lower timeframe shows continuation setup
   - Entry: Momentum candle close
   - Stop: Recent swing low/high + ATR
   - Target: Trend extension or 1.5:1 RR

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
   - Maximum risk: 1% per trade
   - Minimum R:R ratio: 1.5:1
   - Hold time: 15-45 minutes maximum
   - Stop loss: Always use ATR-based stops

5. ENTRY CONDITIONS CHECKLIST:
   ✓ Higher timeframe trend confirmation
   ✓ Lower timeframe entry signal clear
   ✓ Volume supports the move
   ✓ RSI not in extreme territory
   ✓ Clear stop loss level identified
   ✓ Realistic profit target set
